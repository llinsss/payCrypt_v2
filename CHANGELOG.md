## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Local-network authorization integration tests for the Rust/Soroban migration,
  covering success, boundary, unauthorized, replay, and external-call failure
  paths with deterministic ledger/time fixtures (#830).
- Rust SDK domain types for payment amounts (`Amount`, `Asset`, `PaymentIntent`)
  with deterministic validation, serialization/compatibility behavior, and
  actionable error classification (validation, unauthorized, replay, failure),
  plus unit/property/local-network tests covering success, boundary,
  unauthorized, replay, and failure paths (#834).
- Rust SDK contract discovery manifest (`ContractManifest`, `ContractEntry`,
  `ContractKind`) with typed APIs for serialization, compatibility checks,
  cancellation, and actionable error classification, plus deterministic
  validation and unit/property/local-network tests covering success, boundary,
  unauthorized, replay, and failure paths. Includes migration, indexing,
  monitoring, and rollback documentation (#842).
- Local-network upgrade integration tests for the Rust/Soroban migration (#829).
  - Typed upgrade-flow fixtures with deterministic ledger sequence and timestamp
    values so local-network runs are reproducible.
  - Success, boundary, unauthorized, replay, and external-call failure paths are
    exercised against a local Soroban network.
  - Coverage for authorization checks, boundary values (e.g. zero/max upgrade
    amounts and ledger bounds), resource limits, and external-call f

### Security
- Circuit breaker inspection and reset endpoints are now restricted to
  authenticated admins, resets are rate-limited, and successful resets are
  written to the audit log (#553).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-02-21

### Documentation

  signals, and rollback behavior for the local-network integration tests (#829).
