# Withdrawal Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete withdrawal feature for the Tagg Flutter app with dynamic asset selection and fee calculation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Dynamic Asset Selection
- **Loads actual user token balances** from the API
- **Interactive selection** - tap any asset to select it
- **Visual feedback** - selected asset has purple border highlight
- **Shows balance** - displays available amount for each token
- **Token symbol display** - shows first letter as icon and full symbol
- **Loading state** - shows "Loading assets..." while fetching balances

#### How it works:
- Fetches user's token balances via `/balances` endpoint
- Displays all available tokens in a grid layout
- Selected token is used for withdrawal
- Updates available balance display when selection changes

### 2. ✅ Dynamic Fee Calculation
- **Real-time calculation** - fees update as you type the amount
- **Method-based fees** - different rates for different withdrawal methods
- **Three fee types**:
  - Network Fee
  - Platform Fee
  - Total Charge

#### Fee Structure:

**Withdraw to Tag (Internal Transfer)**
- Network Fee: $0.00 (no network fee for internal transfers)
- Platform Fee: 0.1% of amount
- Example: $100 withdrawal = $0.10 platform fee

**Crypto Wallet (External Transfer)**
- Network Fee: 1% of amount
- Platform Fee: 0.5% of amount
- Total: 1.5% of amount
- Example: $100 withdrawal = $1.00 network + $0.50 platform = $1.50 total

**Bank Account (Fiat Conversion)**
- Network Fee: 1.5% of amount (conversion fee)
- Platform Fee: 1% of amount
- Total: 2.5% of amount
- Example: $100 withdrawal = $1.50 conversion + $1.00 platform = $2.50 total

#### How it works:
- Listens to amount input field changes
- Recalculates fees automatically when:
  - User types in amount field
  - User changes withdrawal method
  - User clicks MAX button
- Displays fees in USD with 2 decimal places

### 3. ✅ Enhanced User Experience
- **MAX button** - automatically fills in maximum available balance
- **Balance display** - shows available balance for selected token
- **Form validation** - checks for sufficient balance and valid inputs
- **Loading indicators** - shows progress during API calls
- **Success/Error messages** - clear feedback via snackbar
- **Auto-refresh** - reloads balances after successful withdrawal

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **`/lib/ui/views/withdrawal/withdrawal_viewmodel.dart`**
   - Added fee calculation logic (`_calculateFees()`)
   - Added amount listener for real-time fee updates
   - Made `fees` a computed getter that returns dynamic values
   - Added `setSelectedBalance()` method for asset selection
   - Fee calculation runs on:
     - Amount change
     - Withdrawal method change
     - Initialization

2. **`/lib/ui/views/withdrawal/withdrawal_view.dart`**
   - Replaced static asset grid with dynamic `Wrap` widget
   - Added selection highlighting (purple border for selected asset)
   - Shows token symbol and available balance for each asset
   - Displays loading state when balances are empty
   - Connected to viewmodel's `tokenBalances` and `selectedBalance`

### Key Methods:

```dart
// Calculate fees based on amount and withdrawal method
void _calculateFees() {
  final amount = double.tryParse(amountController.text) ?? 0.0;
  // ... fee calculation logic
  notifyListeners();
}

// Set selected balance for withdrawal
void setSelectedBalance(UserTokenBalance balance) {
  _selectedBalance = balance;
  notifyListeners();
}

// Dynamic fees getter
List<FeeItem> get fees {
  return [
    FeeItem(label: "Network Fee", amount: "\$${_networkFeeAmount.toStringAsFixed(2)}"),
    FeeItem(label: "Platform Fee", amount: "\$${_platformFeeAmount.toStringAsFixed(2)}"),
    FeeItem(label: "Total Charge", amount: "\$${_totalFeeAmount.toStringAsFixed(2)}"),
  ];
}
```

## User Flow

1. **Open Withdrawal Screen**
   - App loads user's token balances
   - First token is auto-selected
   - Fees show $0.00 (no amount entered yet)

2. **Select Asset**
   - User taps on any token to select it
   - Selected token gets purple border
   - Available balance updates

3. **Enter Amount**
   - User types amount or clicks MAX
   - Fees calculate automatically in real-time
   - Shows network fee, platform fee, and total

4. **Change Withdrawal Method** (optional)
   - User selects different method (Tag/Wallet/Bank)
   - Fees recalculate based on new method rates

5. **Enter Recipient Details**
   - For Tag: enter recipient tag
   - For Wallet: enter wallet address
   - For Bank: enter account number

6. **Submit Withdrawal**
   - Validates form (amount, balance, recipient)
   - Shows loading indicator
   - Displays success message with transaction hash
   - Clears form and reloads balances

## Testing

To test the features:

1. **Asset Selection**:
   - Navigate to withdrawal screen
   - Observe your actual tokens loading
   - Tap different tokens and see selection change
   - Verify available balance updates

2. **Fee Calculation**:
   - Enter different amounts (e.g., 10, 50, 100)
   - Watch fees update in real-time
   - Switch between withdrawal methods
   - Verify fees recalculate correctly

3. **Complete Withdrawal**:
   - Select an asset
   - Enter amount
   - Enter recipient tag
   - Submit and verify success message

## Notes

- Fees are calculated client-side for now (no backend endpoint yet)
- Fee rates are configurable in the `_calculateFees()` method
- When backend fee endpoint is available, replace calculation logic with API call
- Asset icons currently show first letter of symbol (can be replaced with actual token logos)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Fee API**: Replace client-side calculation with actual API endpoint
2. **Token Icons**: Add actual token logo images
3. **Fee Breakdown Tooltip**: Show detailed explanation of each fee
4. **Minimum/Maximum Limits**: Add withdrawal limits per token/method
5. **Fee Estimation**: Show estimated fees before entering amount
6. **Multi-Currency Display**: Show fees in both USD and NGN
